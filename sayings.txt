Is life.
Life is pain.
I secretly ingest the salt from your tears.
The universe will die.
Life is game. We all lose.
Even black stuff is not as dark as void within us all.
Remember. Lease must always be paid.
You consume pizza, like inadequacies and self-doubt consume you.
For you, every day is Friday thirteenth.
Your windows were boarded up long, long, time ago. Your house empty. Derelict.
Make most of this time. For the sun will die out in a few billion years.
On cosmic scale, billion years is mere blink of eye. On such scale, you are speck.
You are less than nothing.
Eternity in hell would be more interesting than this beige eye blink of existence.
You are leaf that has fallen from dead tree. You float through life, only to eventually rot into nothingness.
We are all problem that eventually gets divided into zero.
